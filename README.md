# time-tracking-google-calendar-mcp
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) for managing a Google calendar with a set of non-overlapping events representing one person's time

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies.

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For running tests, install the dev dependencies instead (this also installs `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Project layout

Google Calendar API access lives in [`calendar_clients/google_calendar.py`](calendar_clients/google_calendar.py), behind a `CalendarClient` class and a plain `Event` dataclass. `server.py`'s MCP tools call into this module rather than talking to `googleapiclient`/OAuth directly, so the Calendar logic can be unit tested without hitting the real API — tests construct a `CalendarClient` around a mocked `service` object instead.

## Google OAuth credentials

`CalendarClient.from_credentials`, in [`calendar_clients/google_calendar.py`](calendar_clients/google_calendar.py), needs two files, neither of which should ever be committed:

- **`credentials.json`** — the OAuth *client* secret, downloaded once from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for the Google Cloud project you register this server under (APIs & Services → Credentials → create an OAuth client ID of type "Desktop app", then download its JSON). This identifies the application, not you as a user — you obtain it yourself and supply its path.
- **`token.json`** — the *user's* actual access + refresh token. You don't create this yourself: the first time `load_credentials` runs without a valid cached token, it opens a browser for you to log into Google and grant access, then writes the resulting credentials to this path. Every later run reads the cached file back and silently refreshes/rewrites it as the access token expires.

Both paths are required arguments (no defaults), so where they live is up to whatever wires up the server.

## Running the server

With the virtual environment activated, run the server directly:

```bash
python server.py
```

Or launch it with the MCP Inspector for interactive testing:

```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

`mcp dev` requires two tools outside the Python virtual environment: **Node.js/npx** (to launch the Inspector UI itself) and **uv** (the Inspector uses it to run the server in an isolated, on-the-fly environment). Neither is something pip/venv can provide — a venv only manages Python packages already on your machine, not other language runtimes or tools.

**Installing Node.js (provides `npx`):**
- **macOS:** `brew install node`
- **Windows:** `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (or download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- **Linux:** use your distro's package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install nodejs npm`) or install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

**Installing uv:**
- **macOS/Linux:** `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Windows:** `winget install astral-sh.uv` (or `powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`)

After installing, restart your terminal and verify with:

```bash
npx --version
uv --version
```

If you only need to run the server (not the Inspector), `python server.py` works without Node.js or uv.

`server.py` currently contains a minimal scaffold (an `add` tool and a `greeting` resource) from the [MCP Python SDK quickstart](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/), ready to be extended with Google Calendar-backed tools.

## Running tests

With the dev dependencies installed:

```bash
pytest
```
