# time-tracking-google-calendar-mcp
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) for managing a Google calendar with a set of non-overlapping events representing one person's time

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies.

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For running tests, install the dev dependencies instead (this also installs `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Project layout

- [`calendar_clients/google_calendar.py`](calendar_clients/google_calendar.py) — Google Calendar API access, behind a `CalendarClient` class and plain `Event`/`Calendar` dataclasses. Kept separate from `server.py` so the Calendar logic can be unit tested without hitting the real API — tests construct a `CalendarClient` around a mocked `service` object instead. `CalendarClient.create_event_with_reallocation` is the shared entry point both `server.py` and `calendar_cli.py` use to create an event via `utilities/reallocation.py`.
- [`utilities/reallocation.py`](utilities/reallocation.py) — the reallocation algorithm: how creating an event makes room for itself by reclaiming time from lower-priority events and free time in its day. Has no Calendar API dependency of its own — see the module docstring.
- [`server.py`](server.py) — the MCP server; its tools call into `calendar_clients/google_calendar.py` rather than talking to `googleapiclient`/OAuth directly.
- [`workos_auth.py`](workos_auth.py) — verifies bearer tokens issued by WorkOS AuthKit, for when `server.py` is hosted remotely over `streamable-http` instead of run locally over stdio — see [Deploying](#deploying) below.
- [`create_calendar.py`](create_calendar.py) — a standalone bootstrap script (not an MCP tool) that creates the dedicated calendar this app needs — see [Calendar access model](#calendar-access-model) below.
- [`calendar_cli.py`](calendar_cli.py) — a dev-only command-line tool for poking at the calendar directly (`list`/`get`/`update_properties`/`create`) without going through an MCP host — see [Command-line utilities](#command-line-utilities) below.
- [`config.py`](config.py) — reads configuration from environment variables — see [Configuration](#configuration) below.
- [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) — a Render Blueprint for hosting this remotely — see [Deploying](#deploying) below.
- [`tests/`](tests/) — unit tests for the above, mocking the Google API (and WorkOS's JWKS) rather than hitting them.

## Calendar access model

This app requests only the `calendar.app.created` OAuth scope (see `SCOPES` in [`calendar_clients/google_calendar.py`](calendar_clients/google_calendar.py)) — not the broader `calendar.events`/`calendar.events.owned` scopes. That has real consequences:

- This app can only read and write events on calendars **it has created itself**.
- It has **no access to the user's existing calendars** — not `"primary"`, not any calendar they made by hand in the Calendar UI. API calls against any calendar this app didn't create itself will fail.
- This is deliberate: a compromised or misbehaving instance of this app cannot read or touch anything outside the dedicated calendar(s) it made for itself.

**Bootstrapping:** there's no calendar to operate on until this app creates one. Run [`create_calendar.py`](create_calendar.py) once — it only needs `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_PATH`/`GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH` (see [Configuration](#configuration) below), not `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` — and it prints the new calendar's ID:

```bash
python create_calendar.py "Time Tracking"
```

Then set `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` to the ID it prints. If the app hasn't been used to create a calendar yet — including the very first time you set this up — this is the step to run first.

## MCP tools

[`server.py`](server.py) exposes the calendar as five MCP tools:

| Tool | Signature | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_events` | `(min_time, max_time) -> list[PublicEvent]` | Implemented |
| `get_event` | `(id) -> PublicEvent` | Implemented |
| `update_event` | `(event: PublicEvent) -> list[PublicEvent]` | Implemented |
| `create_event` | `(event: PublicEvent) -> list[PublicEvent]` | Implemented |
| `delete_event` | `(id) -> list[PublicEvent]` | Implemented |

`update_event`/`create_event`/`delete_event` all return a `list[PublicEvent]` rather than a single `PublicEvent`, since `update_event`/`create_event` can affect more than the one event acted on (see below). `delete_event` deletes the given event outright (via `CalendarClient.delete_event`) and always returns exactly that one event, wrapped in a single-element list for a consistent return type across all three.

`create_event`/`update_event` both make room for the event via `utilities/reallocation.py`: each fetches the roughly 24 hours of events starting at the event's own `start` (via `CalendarClient.list_day_events`, truncated after the first event marked `is_end_of_day_sleep`, if any — that's "the day" reallocation operates on), then calls `reallocate_for_new_event` and applies whatever it returns (creating or moving the event itself, and updating — shrinking, moving, splitting, or cancelling — whatever else needed to make room). `update_event` (`CalendarClient.update_event_and_reallocate`) additionally excludes the event's own prior position from that day's events first, since `reallocate_for_new_event` refuses a day already containing the event being moved. A `ReallocationConflictError`/`ReallocationShortfallError`/`ValueError` from reallocation is surfaced as a `ToolError`.

Every tool uses `PublicEvent` (defined in `server.py`), not `Event`, as its input/output type — `Event` minus whatever fields are named in `INTERNAL_EVENT_FIELDS`, plus `is_cancelled` (which has no `Event` equivalent — it's derived from the hidden `status` field). Agents communicating with this MCP only see the fields in `PublicEvent`. `calendar_cli.py` still operates on `Event` directly and has full access to every field, since it's a human-run dev tool, not something the agent talks to.

`list_events`/`get_event` still don't surface a cancelled event at all: `list_events` omits it, and `get_event` raises a `ToolError`. But when an operation like `create_event` cancels an event as a side effect of making room, or `delete_event` removes the event it was asked to, that cancellation is a direct result of the agent's own action, so it's worth surfacing rather than hiding — its `PublicEvent` comes back with the rest of its fields intact and `is_cancelled=True`. `is_cancelled` only ever moves from `False` to `True`; setting it `False` has no effect, since there's no way to un-cancel an event through this API.

Calendar creation is deliberately *not* an MCP tool — see [Calendar access model](#calendar-access-model) above — so the model can't create new calendars on its own; that's a one-time, human-run bootstrap step via `create_calendar.py`.

### Why tools, not resources

MCP has both **tools** (model-controlled: the model decides when to call one, with whatever arguments it computes, as part of its own reasoning) and **resources** (application-controlled: a human typically browses and attaches one via the host's UI, like Claude Desktop's "Attach from MCP" picker). This server only uses tools, for two reasons:

- **Portability.** Resources depend on the host having built UI (or another bridging mechanism) for the model to reach them at all; a lot of MCP clients — agentic ones especially — only implement tool-calling and skip resources entirely. Tools work everywhere.
- **Fit.** The natural workflow here is model-driven, not human-browsing-driven: the model discovers an event's ID via `list_events`, then immediately wants to act on it — fetch details, update, delete. That's a tool-calling pattern (one tool's output, the `id` field, feeds directly into the next tool's input) with no need for a resource-URI layer in between. Nobody is going to browse a picker UI for an event by its opaque Google Calendar ID.

## Google OAuth credentials

`CalendarClient.from_credentials`, in [`calendar_clients/google_calendar.py`](calendar_clients/google_calendar.py), needs two files, neither of which should ever be committed:

- **`credentials.json`** — the OAuth *client* secret, downloaded once from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for the Google Cloud project you register this server under (APIs & Services → Credentials → create an OAuth client ID of type "Desktop app", then download its JSON). This identifies the application, not you as a user — you obtain it yourself and supply its path.
- **`token.json`** — the *user's* actual access + refresh token. You don't create this yourself: the first time `load_credentials` runs without a valid cached token, it opens a browser for you to log into Google and grant access, then writes the resulting credentials to this path. Every later run reads the cached file back and refreshes it as the access token expires; rewriting it back to `token_path` afterward is best-effort — if the path turns out not to be writable (see [Deploying](#deploying) below), the refresh still succeeds in memory, just without being persisted.

Both paths are required arguments (no defaults), so where they live is up to whatever wires up the server. For local development, the filenames `credentials.json` and `token.json` are gitignored, so you can drop both files straight into the project root without risk of committing them.

## Configuration

[`config.py`](config.py) reads the server's configuration from environment variables, rather than anything being hardcoded or committed:

| Variable | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` | Yes | — | The calendar to operate on — must be the ID of a calendar this app created itself; see [Calendar access model](#calendar-access-model) above. Run `create_calendar.py` if you don't have one yet. |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | No | `credentials.json` | Path to the OAuth client secret file — see [Google OAuth credentials](#google-oauth-credentials) above. Defaults to the gitignored local filename; override to something with real protections when deployed (see [Deploying](#deploying)). |
| `GOOGLE_OAUTH_TOKEN_PATH` | No | `token.json` | Path to the cached OAuth user token — see [Google OAuth credentials](#google-oauth-credentials) above. Defaults to the gitignored local filename; override to something with real protections when deployed (see [Deploying](#deploying)). |
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | No | `stdio` | `stdio` runs the server as a subprocess a local MCP host spawns directly (Claude Desktop's local config, `mcp dev`). `streamable-http` runs it as a standalone HTTP server instead — set this when hosting it remotely (see [Deploying](#deploying)); the three variables below only matter in that case. |
| `WORKOS_AUTHKIT_DOMAIN` | Only for `streamable-http` | — | The WorkOS AuthKit domain (e.g. `https://your-tenant.authkit.app`) that issues and signs bearer tokens for callers of this server — see [Deploying](#deploying). Unrelated to the Google OAuth variables above: this controls who's allowed to talk to *this* server, not this server's own credential to talk to Google. |
| `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | No | derived from `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` | This server's own public MCP endpoint URL (e.g. `https://your-service.onrender.com/mcp`) — used as the OAuth resource identifier and the audience bearer tokens must carry. On Render this is derived automatically from `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` (which Render sets for you); set it explicitly elsewhere. |
| `PORT` | No | `10000` | The port `streamable-http` binds to (always alongside host `0.0.0.0`, as every Render web service requires). Render sets this for you automatically. |

To supply these locally, copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and fill it in — `config.py` loads `.env` automatically (via `python-dotenv`) if one is present. `.env` is gitignored, so nothing personal ends up committed.

If this server is launched by an MCP host (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.) instead of run standalone, set these same variables in that host's server config under its `env` field — no `.env` file needed in that case.

## Deploying

Hosting this remotely (e.g. on [Render](https://render.com/)) involves **two independent OAuth concerns** — don't confuse them:

1. **This server's own credential to talk to Google** (`credentials.json`/`token.json`, already covered above) — who *this app* is, as far as Google Calendar is concerned.
2. **Who's allowed to talk to *this server*** — once it's reachable at a public URL instead of spawned locally as a subprocess, that URL alone is no longer enough access control. This is what `MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http` and WorkOS AuthKit below are for.

A [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) blueprint is included, covering the build/start command and plain env vars; two things still need to be done by hand in Render's dashboard regardless (a blueprint can't express either):

**1. Google Calendar credentials** (unchanged from before): don't put `credentials.json`/`token.json` in the repo or a regular env var — Render's **Secret Files** feature is built for exactly this: add each file under the service's Environment tab, and Render mounts it at `/etc/secrets/<filename>` at runtime, separate from your source and the regular env var list.
- Run `python create_calendar.py` locally first — it needs an interactive browser for the OAuth consent flow, so it can't run on Render itself. This both generates `token.json` and creates the dedicated calendar in one step; paste the resulting `token.json` into the Secret File, and set `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` on Render to the ID it printed.
- Secret File mounts may be read-only, so `token.json`'s refresh-and-rewrite (see [Google OAuth credentials](#google-oauth-credentials) above) is best-effort by design — a failed write there just means the next process restart refreshes again from the same cached refresh token, which Google doesn't rotate on a normal refresh.

**2. A WorkOS account, configured for AuthKit**, to authenticate *callers* of this server. This app never issues tokens or holds a password itself — over `streamable-http` it's only an OAuth *Resource Server*, checking that a request's bearer token was really issued by WorkOS for this server ([`workos_auth.py`](workos_auth.py) does the actual JWT/JWKS verification). WorkOS AuthKit is the *Authorization Server*: it's what Claude.ai's connector UI talks to when it discovers this server needs auth, dynamically registers itself as a client, and runs you through the login/consent flow — none of that is code in this repo. **You don't create or configure any OAuth application/client yourself** — Claude.ai registers its own at connect time, which is the entire point of Dynamic Client Registration/CIMD below.

To set that up:

1. Sign up at [workos.com](https://workos.com/) — there's nothing else to create; skip straight to the dashboard settings below.
2. Under **Connect → Configuration**, turn on **"Allow MCP clients to authenticate using Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) or Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)"** — this is required: it's off by default, and it's what lets Claude.ai register itself as a client automatically. This same page is where you add this server's deployed URL plus `/mcp` (e.g. `https://your-service.onrender.com/mcp`) as a **Resource Indicator** — mark it as the default one.
3. Find your AuthKit domain under the **Domains** section of the dashboard sidebar (a separate section from Connect, easy to miss). In a Staging environment WorkOS auto-assigns one that looks like `https://your-tenant.authkit.app`; in a Production environment you'll instead see a **Configure AuthKit domain** button to set one up. Set `WORKOS_AUTHKIT_DOMAIN` on Render to that value.

**Staging is fine to stay on** for a personal tool like this one — don't feel pushed toward Production just because it's the other option. Per WorkOS's own [Staging vs. production environments](https://workos.com/docs/authkit/environments) docs, Staging is "fully functional and secure," and the only things gated behind Production are a custom AuthKit domain (cosmetic — `*.authkit.app` works identically otherwise) and billing details. Production's SLA/"customer-facing traffic" language in WorkOS's terms is aimed at real multi-tenant SaaS products serving external customers out of staging by mistake; it doesn't really describe a single hobbyist authenticating only themselves. The billing requirement is also moot in practice for this project either way — what actually gets charged is SSO/Directory Sync connections, features this project never touches (it only uses Connect/OAuth).

Don't try to test this by visiting the AuthKit domain directly in a browser — that's AuthKit's own generic hosted sign-in page (it'll ask you to log in and then complain about a missing sign-in callback), a completely different, unrelated flow that really does expect a manually-configured application. It has nothing to do with the MCP/DCR setup above. The real test is connecting from Claude.ai (below): Claude.ai itself constructs the correct authorization request, with its own dynamically-registered client id and redirect URI, so there's nothing to configure or test by hand first.

With both in place, set `MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http` (already in `render.yaml`) and deploy. `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` doesn't need setting explicitly on Render — it's derived from `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL`, which Render provides automatically.

Local development is entirely unaffected by any of this: `python server.py` with no `MCP_TRANSPORT` set (the default) still runs over stdio, and none of `WORKOS_AUTHKIT_DOMAIN`/`MCP_PUBLIC_URL` is read in that case.

### Connecting from Claude.ai

Once deployed, add it under claude.ai's **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, using your server's URL plus `/mcp` (e.g. `https://your-service.onrender.com/mcp`). Claude.ai takes it from there — discovering that the server requires auth, finding your WorkOS AuthKit project, registering itself as a client, and walking you through the login/consent flow — before it can call any tool.

## Running the server

With the virtual environment activated, run the server directly:

```bash
python server.py
```

Or launch it with the MCP Inspector for interactive testing:

```bash
mcp dev server.py
```

`mcp dev` requires two tools outside the Python virtual environment: **Node.js/npx** (to launch the Inspector UI itself) and **uv** (the Inspector uses it to run the server in an isolated, on-the-fly environment). Neither is something pip/venv can provide — a venv only manages Python packages already on your machine, not other language runtimes or tools.

**Installing Node.js (provides `npx`):**
- **macOS:** `brew install node`
- **Windows:** `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (or download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- **Linux:** use your distro's package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install nodejs npm`) or install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

**Installing uv:**
- **macOS/Linux:** `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Windows:** `winget install astral-sh.uv` (or `powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`)

After installing, restart your terminal and verify with:

```bash
npx --version
uv --version
```

If you only need to run the server (not the Inspector), `python server.py` works without Node.js or uv.

See [MCP tools](#mcp-tools) above for what `server.py` currently exposes.

## Command-line utilities

[`calendar_cli.py`](calendar_cli.py) is a dev tool for calling the calendar directly from a terminal, without going through an MCP host — useful for poking around or debugging. It's not named `calendar.py`: that would shadow Python's stdlib `calendar` module, which `google-auth`/`httplib2` (both used by `calendar_clients/google_calendar.py`) import internally. Its one extra dependency, `pytimeparse`, lives in `requirements-dev.txt`, not `requirements.txt` — install the dev dependencies (see [Setup](#setup)) to use it.

```bash
# Events from 1 hour ago to 1 hour from now (the default window)
python calendar_cli.py list

# Events from 30 minutes ago to 2 hours from now
python calendar_cli.py list 30m 2h

# A single event by id
python calendar_cli.py get <event-id>

# Set one or more properties on an existing event
python calendar_cli.py update_properties <event-id> priority=1 location="Room A"

# Move/resize an existing event, reallocating time from its day as needed
python calendar_cli.py update <event-id> start=2026-01-01T09:30:00-05:00 end=2026-01-01T10:00:00-05:00

# Create a new event, reallocating time from its day as needed
python calendar_cli.py create summary="Focus block" start=2026-01-01T09:00:00-05:00 end=2026-01-01T10:00:00-05:00 priority=1

# Delete an event by id
python calendar_cli.py delete <event-id>
```

`from`/`to` are each a duration relative to *now* — parsed with [pytimeparse](https://pypi.org/project/pytimeparse/) (e.g. `"1h"`, `"90m"`, `"2d"`, `"1:30"`) — giving a window from `now - from` to `now + to`. Both are optional and default to `1h`.

`update_properties` takes one or more `key=value` pairs, where each `key` is an `Event` attribute (`summary`, `start`, `end`, `description`, `location`, `min_duration`, `is_fixed_duration`, `priority` — not `id`, since changing it would repoint the patch at a different event). It builds an `Event` with just those attributes set (everything else `None`) and patches it straight in, without fetching the event first — Calendar's `patch` semantics mean any attribute you don't mention is left exactly as it was server-side. `start`/`end` take an ISO 8601 datetime with a UTC offset (e.g. `2026-01-01T09:00:00-05:00`, or a trailing `Z`); `min_duration` takes a pytimeparse duration like `from`/`to` above; `is_fixed_duration` takes `true`/`false` (also `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no`).

`update` takes the same `key=value` pairs as `update_properties` (`start` and `end` are required this time) and calls `CalendarClient.update_event_and_reallocate` — the same reallocation-aware path `server.py`'s `update_event` MCP tool uses (see [MCP tools](#mcp-tools) above) — reallocating time from the rest of the event's day as needed to make room for its new position. Prints every event the call created or changed, not just the moved one. Use `update_properties` instead for a plain patch that doesn't move the event (e.g. just renaming it) — `update` always needs a real `(start, end)` span to make room for, since that's what reallocation acts on.

`create` takes the same `key=value` pairs as `update_properties` (`summary`, `start`, and `end` are required this time) and builds a new `Event` from them, then calls `CalendarClient.create_event_with_reallocation` — the same reallocation-aware creation path `server.py`'s `create_event` MCP tool uses (see [MCP tools](#mcp-tools) above). Prints every event the call created or changed, not just the new one.

For a recurring event, the id from `list`/`get` names one specific *instance*.  To change a property for the entire series of recurring events, use the `recurring_event_id` that's visible from `get`.  See Google's [recurring events guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/recurringevents) for more on how instances and recurring events relate.
